		This will probably end up being the most informative page on my site. Hopefully someone can find
		some use for these reviews and FAQs. I'll post the FAQs in their own page, but they're also
		listed <a href="https://www.gamefaqs.com">here</a>. The reviews are here and here only. You
		might find a few on
		<a href="https://www.nintendo.com">Nintendo</a>, and that's okay. Thanks for reading!
