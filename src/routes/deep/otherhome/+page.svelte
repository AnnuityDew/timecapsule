		links, add-ons, fan-mail, etc.) please e-mail me at an old email address that no longer exists.
		Absolutely all, and I mean <i>all</i> e-mails welcome (except for you spammers,of course. No offense,
		but I don't really like that stuff. (Heck, I don't even like the color of the can. Dark blue? C'mon,
		you can do better than that.))

		Wow, I got <i>way</i> off topic... :)
