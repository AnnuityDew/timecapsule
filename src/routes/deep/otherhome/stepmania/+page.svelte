		This is my stat bar for the awesome DDR sim, StepMania. Played entirely on the keyboard (or a
		dancepad if you really want to hook one up), it lets you download whatever stepfiles you would
		like in your library. You just have to do a little searching. If your song isn't a stepfile, you
		could always make it yourself and share it with all. (I don't know much about this, though.) For
		more information, click the stat bar to take you to StepMania Online. Click "Getting Started" on
		the left side to begin. Have fun!
