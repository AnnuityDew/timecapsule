		If you have arrived at this page, it means I'm close to graduating! The commencement exercises
		for Landstown's Class of 2010 begin at 7pm, Friday, June 18th. (Probably today if you're reading
		this!) The purpose of this page is to direct you to the page where you can watch the broadcast
		LIVE online! And if you miss the live broadcast, this is also the page where you will be able to
		access the replay of the ceremony. So don't wait any longer!

		Grab some popcorn and enjoy the show. I promise to do my absolute best to give the Class of 2010
		the speech they deserve. :D
